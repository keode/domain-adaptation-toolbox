== QUICK START =================================================

Either open ssa.jar using the GUI of your operating system 
(e.g. double-click under Windows) or type 

  java -jar ssa.jar

on the command line.
If you want to run SSA on very large data sets, it might be necessary
to increase the Java heap space. For example, the following command 
would start the toolbox with 512M Java heap space:

  java -Xmx512M -jar ssa.jar

In order to run SSA under Matlab, change into this directory and
type 

  help ssa

on the Matlab command line. For an example see ssa_example.m.
Also here it might be necessary to increase the Java heap space which
Matlab uses. The following website explains how to do that:
